# AI-Driven Stock Trend Forecasting and Signal Generation Web App

## Project Overview
This MSc AI final year project aims to develop a sophisticated web application that leverages artificial intelligence to forecast stock market trends and generate trading signals. The system combines traditional technical analysis with modern machine learning approaches to provide actionable insights for investors.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Real-time stock data fetching and processing
- Advanced technical indicator calculations
- Machine learning-based trend prediction
- Interactive web interface for visualization
- Automated trading signal generation
- Performance backtesting capabilities

## Project Architecture
- `/data`: Storage for raw and processed stock market data (CSV files)
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development
- `/models`: Trained machine learning model files
- `/app`: Streamlit/Flask web application code
- `/utils`: Utility functions and technical indicators
- `/reports`: Project documentation and progress tracking

## Tech Stack
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Financial Data**: yfinance
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit/Flask (TBD)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, tensorflow (TBD)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the web application (instructions TBD)

## Project Status
