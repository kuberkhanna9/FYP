# Generative AI Usage Journal (Week-wise)

This journal documents my transparent and minimal use of Generative AI tools during the development of my MSc AI final project: "AI-Driven Stock Trend Forecasting and Signal Generation Web App". The goal is to demonstrate responsible AI usage while maintaining academic integrity and original thinking.

## Week 1: June 20 – June 26, 2025

### Tools Used
- Cursor IDE (basic code completion), ChatGPT (minimal syntax clarification)

### Purpose
- Brainstorming project structure and naming conventions
- Verifying Python syntax and folder structures for Streamlit
- Cursor for file creation templates and markdown formatting

### Manual Work
- Designed system architecture and planned stock selection strategies
- Identified initial technical indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA)
- Built initial version for 3 stocks using yfinance and Streamlit

### Reflection
GenAI was used minimally to support the brainstorming and setup phases. All implementation logic and design decisions were original and manually executed.

## Week 2: June 27 – July 3, 2025

### Tools Used
- Cursor IDE, ChatGPT (syntax lookup only)

### Purpose
- Help with matplotlib subplot formatting
- Check scikit-learn API parameters
- Basic code completion in Jupyter notebooks

### Manual Work
- Created feature engineering logic from scratch
- Implemented technical indicators manually
- Visualized EMA/RSI/MACD with interactive plots

### Reflection
Only used GenAI for syntax checking. All modeling logic, feature creation, and visual analysis were implemented based on personal understanding and financial knowledge.

## Week 3: July 4 – July 10, 2025

### Tools Used
- Cursor IDE, ChatGPT (deployment-related clarification)

### Purpose
- Confirm SHAP integration with Streamlit
- Verify XGBoost hyperparameter usage
- Streamlit app file structure suggestions

### Manual Work
- Built XGBoost model pipeline and evaluated predictions
- Integrated SHAP interpretability in both Jupyter and Streamlit
- Completed Streamlit deployment to Streamlit Cloud manually

### Reflection
GenAI was used only to speed up deployment syntax and embed plotting functions. Model logic, feature interpretation, and app design were fully manual and original.

## Week 4: July 11 – July 17, 2025

### Tools Used
- Cursor IDE (minor scaffold suggestions), ChatGPT (syntax clarification)

### Purpose
- Clarified setup.sh and requirements.txt structure for deployment
- Quick syntax checks for pandas and SHAP explanations
- Streamlit layout feedback using Cursor

### Manual Work
- Finalized web UI for predictions
- Created SHAP explanations with minimal AI intervention
- Prepared early backtesting logic independently

### Reflection
Cursor was used only to enhance developer productivity. The logic behind predictions, SHAP insights, and interface layout was my own, tailored to project goals.

## Week 5: July 18 – August 2, 2025

### Tools Used
- Cursor IDE (markdown and file generation), ChatGPT (very limited usage)

### Purpose
- Prompt polishing
- Cross-verifying neural network logic for future integration
- Planning new data structure for 100+ NASDAQ stocks

### Manual Work
- Held meetings with supervisor and pivoted strategy to full-sector modeling
- Refactored entire codebase to support scalable model architecture
- Manually updated old files and planned transition to neural networks

### Reflection
This week involved heavy refactoring and planning. While GenAI was consulted occasionally, the major rewrites and structural logic for scaling to a full NASDAQ-100 system were done manually.
